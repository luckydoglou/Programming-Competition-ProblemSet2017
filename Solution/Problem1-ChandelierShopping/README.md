1 - Chandelier Shopping
Ada Lovelace wants to buy a chandelier, but doesn’t know how many layers she can afford. The first layer has 1 crystal, and each layer above has 1 crystal more than the layer below it. A chandelier costs $100 per crystal.
Given a number of layers, tell Ada Lovelace the price of the chandelier and display what the chandelier would look like, representing each crystal as ‘$’ (shown in the examples below).
